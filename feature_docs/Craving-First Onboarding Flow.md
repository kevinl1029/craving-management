# Craving-First Onboarding Flow  
### For Ascend Nicotine Cessation Program  

---

## 1. Overview  

The **Craving-First Flow** is the user's first experience with the Ascend Nicotine Cessation app. It’s designed to intercept cravings *in the moment*, deliver instant relief, and seed curiosity for deeper understanding — eventually guiding users toward the **Freedom Journey**, Ascend’s premium program that permanently eliminates the desire for nicotine.  

This flow balances **behavioral science**, **Allen Carr’s Easy Way principles**, and **LLM-driven conversational experiences** to provide both immediate value and a clear path to enlightenment.

|-------|----------|------|
| **Free Tier: Craving Relief** | Offer immediate help during cravings | “Help me right now.” |
| **Premium Tier: Desire Elimination (Freedom Journey)** | Dismantle nicotine myths & dissolve the desire entirely | “Make me free permanently.” |

The craving feature is the entry point — the *moment of maximum leverage* when the user is emotionally open and actively seeking relief. From here, Ascend transitions users toward understanding-based liberation.

## 4. Stage-by-Stage Design  

### **Stage 1 — Entry: The Craving Trigger**

**Screen Copy:**  
> “Feeling a craving right now?”  

**Options:**  
- 🔘 “Yes — help me now” *(Primary CTA)*  
- “No, just exploring” *(Secondary)*  

**Tone:** calm, validating, non-judgmental.  

**LLM Script Example:**  
> “Good — that means your body is healing. Let’s take a minute to ride this wave together.”  

---

### **Stage 2 — Relief: The Craving Companion (LLM Interaction)**  

**Flow (30–60 seconds):**  

1. **Visualization:**  
   > “Picture the craving as a small wave of energy. Feel it rise… now let it fall.”  

2. **Breathing:**  
   > “Take one slow breath. Notice — the feeling is already changing.”  

3. **Reframe:**  
   > “You don’t actually want nicotine. You’re just feeling your body return to balance.”  

4. **Feedback Check:**  
   > “On a scale of 1–10, how strong is the craving now?”  

5. **Micro-win:**  
   > “Beautiful — you just weakened the craving circuit. Each time you ride it out, it loses power.”

### **Stage 3 — Reflection: Opening the Curiosity Door**  

After relief:  

**Screen Copy:**  
> “That craving’s gone. But do you know *why* it appeared in the first place?”  

**Options:**  
- “Yes — tell me why” *(Curiosity path)*  
- “Not now” *(Dismiss but retain data)*  

**LLM Follow-up Example:**
